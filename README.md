# Practicegames
This repository is for practicing code while making something fun

I ideally want to make some full fledged games at some point but for the mean time this will be a testing ground to try out things I learn in class and apply them. 
For the time being I will be using C++
I will be trying to create a probability and math based game to start all based on input/output in the console.
